Overview
Project focused on the use of generic methods and wildcards in Java. Each exercise demonstrates the versatility of generics, their applicability in reusable methods, and their ability to accept different data types, reinforcing principles of type safety and code reusability.
Want to polish it further for presentation or documentation? I can help rephrase or format it to match any style.

| 1      | 1        | Class NoGenericMethods with three arguments of the same type and accessor methods.            |
|        | 2        | Class GenericMethods with a generic method that prints three parameters of different types    |
| 2      | 1        | Modification of the generic method with one non-generic argument                              |
|        | 2        |Use of generic varargs with undefined types (wildcards                                         |
